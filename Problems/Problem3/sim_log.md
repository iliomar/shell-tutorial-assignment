#  Assignment 3: Analyze Astrophysics Simulation Logs with Shell Scripts

In this exercise, you'll write a shell script to analyze `.log` files generated from astrophysics simulations. These files may contain lines labeled `ERROR` or `WARNING`, and your job is to extract insights from them using core shell tools.

---

##  Scenario

You are given a directory:

simulation_logs/


This folder contains multiple `.log` files generated by simulation software. Each file may include messages like:

- `ERROR Could not initialize parameter XYZ`
- `WARNING Using default timestep`

---

##  Tasks

Write a Bash script named `analyze_logs.sh` that does the following:

1. **Find all `.log` files** inside `simulation_logs/` using `find`.
2. **Count and print** the total number of log files found.
3. For **each file that contains `ERROR`**, print:
   - The filename
   - The number of lines that include the word `ERROR`
4. **Count how many files** contain:
   - At least one `ERROR`
   - At least one `WARNING`
5. Extract all lines containing the word `ERROR` from all `.log` files and write them into:

all_errors.txt

6. **(Optional Bonus)**: Print the top 5 most frequent error messages (lines) from `all_errors.txt`.

## Tips & Hints

- Use `find` to search for `.log` files recursively:
```bash
find simulation_logs/ -type f -name "*.log"
